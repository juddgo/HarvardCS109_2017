The specific task is to build a regression model for a bike share system that can predict the total number of bike rentals in a given day, based on attributes about the day. Such a demand forecasting model would be useful in planning the number of bikes that need to be available in the system on any given day, and also in monitoring traffic in the city. The data for this problem was collected from the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington D.C. over two years.   \n",
